# 📘 Summary of Item 9: *Entity Graphs & Basic Attributes*

## 🎯 **Core Idea**
This item explains how **JPA Entity Graphs** behave when used with **basic attributes** in Hibernate, why they don’t always work as expected, and how **Hibernate Bytecode Enhancement** is required to make lazy loading of basic fields effective.

---

# 🧩 Key Concepts

## 🔹 1. **Entity Graphs and Basic Attributes**
- Entity graphs allow you to specify which attributes should be fetched eagerly.
- Basic attributes (`String`, `int`, etc.) default to `FetchType.EAGER`.
- Marking them as `@Basic(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` *does not work* in Hibernate unless Bytecode Enhancement is enabled.

## 🔹 2. **Fetch Graph vs Load Graph**
| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Fetch Graph** | Only attributes in the graph are treated as eager; all others become lazy. |
| **Load Graph** | Attributes in the graph are eager; others follow their default fetch type. |

However, Hibernate **ignores** these rules for basic attributes unless enhanced.

# 📚 Example Scenario
The PDF uses an `Author`–`Book` relationship:

- `Author` has fields: `id`, `name`, `genre`, `age`, and a list of `books`.
- An entity graph is defined to load only:
  - `name`
  - `books`

But when executing repository methods with `@EntityGraph`, Hibernate still fetches `age` and `genre` even though they’re not in the graph.

---

# ⚠️ Why This Happens
Hibernate treats basic attributes as eager by default and **does not honor** lazy loading for them unless **Bytecode Enhancement** is enabled.

---

# 🔧 Solution: Enable Hibernate Bytecode Enhancement
The item recommends enabling enhancement via Maven:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId>
  <artifactId>hibernate-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.10.Final</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <configuration>
        <enableLazyInitialization>true</enableLazyInitialization>
      </configuration>
      <goals>
        <goal>enhance</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Once enabled:
- Fetch graphs and load graphs behave as expected.
- Basic attributes marked as lazy are no longer fetched unless needed.

---

# 🏁 Final Takeaways
- Without bytecode enhancement, Hibernate **ignores lazy loading** for basic attributes.
- Entity graphs alone cannot control basic attribute fetching.
- Enabling enhancement ensures:
  - Correct lazy loading
  - Cleaner, more efficient SQL queries
  - Proper separation of what data is fetched in each use case
